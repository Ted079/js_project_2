# js_project_2
Website about bank deposit settlements with capitalization and replenishment, as well as a page-calculator with its use. There is also a tab for converting currencies into rubles and dollars.
To create this site, I used technologies such as html, —Åss and javascript.
The main functionality of the site is the calculation of a deposit with capitalization, where it returns a detailed response containing: the amount of the deposit at the end of the term, the amount of replenishment, accrued interest, error message.
To create such a functional, I wrote two "declaration" functions. In the first "calculate" function, wrote formulas for calculations and call the second "checkValue" function, which checks the correctness of writing data by the user.
And I took the color scheme from the site https://colorhunt.co/
